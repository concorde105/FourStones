Four Stones

The goal is to leave the other player (either the computer or a second human player) with no moves left. You switch turns, picking a letter and sliding it to the left. A letter may be slid as little or as far as you want, but you must move it at least one space and it cannot move past another letter or off the left side of the board. Additionally, a letter cannot move right.

A board measures 4x10 and looks like this:

. . A B . . . C . . 

. . . . . . D . . .

. . E . . . . . F .

. G . H . I . . . J


A period represents an empty space that a letter can be moved to, provided another letter is not blocking it. For example, D can be moved 1-6 "dots" all the way to the left whereas C could only move 1-3 dots until it hits B. Once a letter reaches as far left as possible, it cannot be moved anymore. If playing against a computer, the player has an option to go first or second.

When the game begins, it asks you if you want to play single player or multiplayer kind of like this:

Welcome to (Game Name)!

[S]ingle player

[M]ulti player

[I]nstructions

[E]xit game


What would you like to do? _

The player then has a chance to key in either S, M, I, or E for single player, multi player, instructions, or to close the game, respectively.

If single player is picked, the player gets the following option before the actual game loads:

Would you like to go [1]st or [2]nd?

If the player answers with 1st, he or she gets to make the first move. Otherwise, the computer does. When the game is over, the screen shows something like this:

Computer wins!

A B C . . . . . . .

D . . . . . . . . . 

E F . . . . . . . . 

G H I J . . . . . . 


You lose! Would you like to: _
[S]tart the game over.
[C]lose the game.

And in multi player:

 Player 2 wins !

A B C . . . . . . . 

D . . . . . . . . .

E F . . . . . . . .

G H I J . . . . . .


Player 1 loses! Would you like to: _
[S]tart the game over.
[C]lose the game.

As you can see, not much of a difference except for differentiating which player won. Player 1 is generally the first player to move while Player 2 is the second.
